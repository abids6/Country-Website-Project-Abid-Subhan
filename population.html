        <h2>How Many People Live in Afghanistan?</h2>
        <p>
          Afghanistan has a population of about <strong>40 million people</strong>.
          The population is growing, and many people are young. Most people live
          in villages and small cities, but there are also large cities like
          Kabul, Herat, and Mazar-i-Sharif.

        <h2>Ethnic Groups</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most special things about Afghanistan is its
          <strong>ethnic diversity</strong>. Some of the main groups are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pashtuns</li>
          <li>Tajiks</li>
          <li>Hazaras</li>
          <li>Uzbeks</li>
          <li>And other smaller groups</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These groups have different languages, clothing styles, and traditions,
          but they all share the same country.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Religion and Culture</h2>
        <p>
          Most people in Afghanistan are <strong>Muslim</strong>, and there are
          both <strong>Sunni</strong> and <strong>Shia</strong> communities.
          Religion is an important part of daily life and culture. It influences
          holidays, family life, and traditions.
        </p>

        <h2>Why I Included Population</h2>
        <p>
          I included a population page to show how many different kinds of people
          live in Afghanistan. Even though there are many ethnic groups and
          beliefs, they are all part of the same country. This diversity is one of
          the reasons Afghanistan is so interesting.
