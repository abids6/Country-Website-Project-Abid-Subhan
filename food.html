        <h2>Why I Included Food</h2>
        <p>
          I chose to include a food page because Afghan food is one of the best
          ways to experience the culture. When people try the food, they often
          learn to appreciate the country more. I hope this page makes visitors
          curious to try Afghan dishes themselves.
