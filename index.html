        <h2>Welcome to Afghanistan</h2>
        <p>
          The country I chose is <strong>Afghanistan</strong>. It is located in
          <strong>Central Asia</strong>. Afghanistan is special because it has many
          different ethnic groups, such as Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks.
          The food is also very popular and loved by many people. Some well-known
          dishes are Kabuli Pulao, Bolani, Ashak, Mantu (dumplings), and Kabab.
        </p>
        <p>
          The country is also known for its beautiful mountain ranges, including
          the mountains near Jalalabad and Kabul. I am from Nangarhar, Afghanistan,
          and what I love most is how hospitable and humble the people are. I visited
          Afghanistan in the summer of 2024, and it was the best experience of my life.
