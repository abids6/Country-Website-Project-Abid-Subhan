            <h2>Welcome to Afghanistan</h2>
            <p>
                The country I chose is <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, located in Central Asia.
                It is known for its beautiful mountains, strong culture, and diverse ethnic groups such 
                as Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks. Afghan food is also loved around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am from Nangarhar, Afghanistan. The people there are extremely humble and 
                hospitable. When I visited in 2024, it was the best experience of my life.

            <p>
                I want visitors to understand the real beauty of Afghanistan — not what the 
                media shows. I hope this website inspires others to appreciate Afghan culture
                and maybe even visit someday.
