    <h2>Welcome to Afghanistan</h2>
    <p>
        Afghanistan is a country in Central Asia. It has many mountains, beautiful landscapes,
        and different kinds of people. Some of the main ethnic groups are Pashtuns, Tajiks,
        Hazaras and Uzbeks. Afghanistan is also known for its amazing food such as Kabuli Pulao,
        Bolani, Ashak, Mantu, Kabab and a cold dessert called Sheryakh.

    <p>
        I am from Nangarhar, Afghanistan. When I visited in the summer of 2024 it was the best
        experience of my life. The people there are very humble and welcoming. They treat guests
        with respect and always try to make them feel at home.

    <h2>Why This Website Matters</h2>
    <p>
        I made this website because I want people to see the real side of Afghanistan.
        Many times people only hear negative things about this country. There is much more than that.
        There is beauty in the land, the culture and the people. I hope that when you finish reading
        this website you understand Afghanistan better and maybe even want to visit one day.
