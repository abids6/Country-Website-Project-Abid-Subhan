            <h2>A Long Past</h2>
            <p>
                Afghanistan has a long and powerful history. The land has been important for thousands of years.
                It is located between Europe and Asia so many traders, travelers and soldiers passed through it.
                Different rulers and empires wanted to control this area because it connects different parts of the world.

            <h2>The Graveyard of Empires</h2>
            <p>
                Afghanistan is sometimes called the Graveyard of Empires. This name is used because many strong
                countries tried to invade and rule Afghanistan but they could not keep control of it. One example is
                the Soviet Union which entered Afghanistan in 1979. The people of Afghanistan fought very hard and
                after many years the Soviet Union withdrew from the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mountains, the tough land and the spirit of the people made it very difficult for outsiders
                to stay in control. This is why Afghanistan is known for defeating powerful invaders.

            <h2>Modern Afghanistan</h2>
            <p>
                In recent times Afghanistan has faced wars, conflict and changes in government. Even with all of these
                problems the people of Afghanistan still work to protect their families and culture. Many Afghans hope
                for a future with peace and stability where children can grow up safely and follow their dreams.
