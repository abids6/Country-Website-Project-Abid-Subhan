        <h2>Why Afghanistan Is Important in History</h2>
        <p>
          Afghanistan has a long and rich history. It is located at the crossroads
          of Asia, so many empires and traders passed through this land. For
          thousands of years, different groups tried to control it, including
          ancient empires, the British, the Soviets, and more.

        <h2>The “Graveyard of Empires”</h2>
        <p>
          Afghanistan is sometimes called the <strong>“Graveyard of Empires”</strong>.
          This nickname comes from the fact that large powers have tried to conquer
          it, but failed or faced serious problems. For example, the
          <strong>Soviet Union</strong> invaded Afghanistan in 1979 and tried to
          control it, but after many years of fighting, they had to leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difficult mountains, strong local resistance, and long history of
          people defending their land have all made Afghanistan hard to control.

        <h2>Recent History</h2>
        <p>
          In recent years, Afghanistan has faced wars, foreign invasions, and
          conflicts inside the country. Even with all these challenges, the people
          have stayed strong, and many Afghans hope for peace and a better future.

        <h2>Why I Included History</h2>
        <p>
          I chose to include the history of Afghanistan on this website because it
          helps people understand why the country is important and why it is known
          around the world. Knowing the history also helps visitors see that there
          is more to Afghanistan than just what they see in the news.
