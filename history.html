            <p>
                Afghanistan has a rich history that stretches back thousands of years. Due to its 
                location between Europe and Asia, many empires and invaders traveled through the 
                region.

            <h2>The Graveyard of Empires</h2>
            <p>
                Afghanistan earned its nickname because powerful nations failed to conquer it.
                The Soviet Union entered Afghanistan in 1979, but after years of fighting, they 
                withdrew. No empire has ever fully controlled Afghanistan.

                In recent decades, Afghanistan has experienced conflict and political changes,
                but the people remain strong, proud, and hopeful for peace.
